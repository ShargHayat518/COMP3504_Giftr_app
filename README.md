# COMP3504_Giftr_app

This application allows a user to sign up using their email. After a verification code has been recieved and entered, the user can log into the application. 
Once inside, the user sees a list of friends sorted by nearest birthday. If there are no friends added, the user can add them from the edit friend page where they are asked
to enter attributes about their friend including their interests. 

Once the friend's interests are stored, the application pulls data from Amazon's API to create a list of gift recommendations for each of the user's friends.
